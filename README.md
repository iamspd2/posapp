<h1 align="center">Restaurant - PoS App</h1>

This Android project is a complete restaurant ordering app that takes care of all the Point of Sales (PoS) in a system.

## PoS and its needs
A point of sale system (PoS) is the place where the customer makes a payment for products or services at our store. Every time a customer makes a purchase at your store, they’re completing a PoS transaction.
It serves as the central component for your business: it’s the hub where everything, like sales, inventory and customer management merge. An efficient PoS system ensures that all operations are running smoothly in a retail environment, like bars and restaurants.

Let us see the screens and understand how the app works.

## Sign Up
This is the screen where a new user registers themselves to this app. Proper validation checks have been added to it, besides Firebase Auth taking care of the registration process.

## Sign In
This is the screen where an already registered user signs in to this app. The credentials are checked against the Firebase Auth registered users for the app. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to ‘Profile’ screen, or an appropriate message is displayed.
