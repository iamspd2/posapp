<h1 align="center">Restaurant - PoS App</h1>

This Android project is a complete restaurant ordering app that takes care of all the Point of Sales (PoS) in a system.

## PoS and its needs
A point of sale system (PoS) is the place where the customer makes a payment for products or services at our store. Every time a customer makes a purchase at your store, they’re completing a PoS transaction.
It serves as the central component for your business: it’s the hub where everything, like sales, inventory and customer management merge. An efficient PoS system ensures that all operations are running smoothly in a retail environment, like bars and restaurants.

Let us see the screens and understand how the app works.
